We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for scalable epistemic uncertainty estimation methods in deep learning. It is specifically designed to test the robustness required in real-world computer vision applications. We also apply our proposed framework to provide the first properly extensive and conclusive comparison of the two current state-of-the-art scalable methods: ensembling and MC-dropout. Our comparison demonstrates that ensembling consistently provides more reliable and practically useful uncertainty estimates.
